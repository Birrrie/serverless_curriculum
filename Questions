- Check format used

Course: Write Serverless functions with AWS Lambda
- I like this post too: https://hackernoon.com/creating-serverless-functions-with-python-and-aws-lambda-901d202d45dc (Charlotte)

Course: Search data with Algolia
- There's barely any external content (Sander)
- I can't find a good source for task 5 "Write a complex query" (Sander)

Course: Combine Lambda functions into larger systems
- I'm having some difficulties describing this course. Could you elaborate? What do you mean with "systems"? (Sander)

Course: 
- I combined tasks 'Make a plan' and 'Apply a plan' because I found a nice blog post that explained them both (and more): https://adamcod.es/2015/10/22/a-pracitcal-introduction-to-terraform-tutorial.html. Other info I can find is nearly all Terraform docs or GitHub threads.
